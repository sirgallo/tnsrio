What is a vector?

A vector is multi-dimentional space with points that represent different features on the vector. You can think of this as a table with rows and columns, where each row is a vector and each column in the row that contains attributes is a feature. A vector database is a database system specialized in storing and indexing vectors. They utilize a special property called vector similarity, which is a measure of how alike two different vectors are, usually using the `distance` and `angle` in a multi-dimentional space. This helps cluster similar data together.
